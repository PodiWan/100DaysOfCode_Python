# Day 9
## Silent Bidding - or Blind Auction

A simulation of how a blind auction would go about. One user inputs his name and bid and passes the computer to another user, if necessary. The console is cleared in order to maintain the blind auction format. 
At the end, the user with the highest bid "wins" and his information is displayed.
The information of the highest bidder is the only data stored throughout the entire execution.
